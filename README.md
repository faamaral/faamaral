### Hey, I'm Fabiano Amaral Alves âœŒ

I'm studying bachelor's degree in information systems in **Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of the Northern Minas Gerais (IFNMG)**.

My first contact with programming language was in 2015, but i decided to take other paths.
Only in 2018 when i joined in college, emerged in me the passion for programming. Since then, i've been trying more and more about the whole programming and develoment ecosystems.
I also have a great curiosity and interest in machine learning and artificial intellogence applications.
