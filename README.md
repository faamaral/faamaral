### Hey, I'm Fabiano Amaral Alves ✌

I'm studying bachelor's degree in information systems in **Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of the Northern Minas Gerais (IFNMG)** 👨‍🎓.

My first contact with programming language was in 2015, but i decided to take other paths.
Only in 2018 when i joined in college, emerged in me the passion for programming. Since then, i've been trying more and more about the whole programming and develoment ecosystems.
I also have a great curiosity and interest in machine learning and artificial intellogence applications.

Currently, i am dedicated to develoment a small blog app [blog-to-learn](https://github.com/faamaral/blog-to-learning) using **Flask Framawork**🧪 in order to share what i learn in college subjects with other people, and engaged to learn cross-plataform development with **Flutter** 💙.
